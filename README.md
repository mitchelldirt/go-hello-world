## Learning Golang

I'm using this repo to throw all of the Go that I'm learning. I'll try and keep updating the READme with my thoughts on the language as I learn new things.

### Update 1 (2021-10-11)

Golang is not Typescript ðŸ˜³. What I mean by that is golang is verrrrry different to Javascript/Typescript and my brain is trying to fight to keep using JS/TS methods. 

I love how simple the language feels so far syntax wise. It's very easy to read and understand what's going on. The use of some lower level concepts like pointers and structs is weird to me, but I think it's good to push myself outside of JS/TS comfort zone.
